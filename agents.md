## 📅 Session Log: 2026-07-09

### 📋 Current Status & Tasks completed:

- Established the **Full Development & Deployment Plan** for the Flutter Retailer App.
- Defined the core feature set, folder structure, and dependencies.
- Created this `agents.md` file to track all sessions, chats, and progress inside the CLI workspace.
- **Identified Flutter SDK issue**: Encountered a write permission error on `C:\Users\niran\flutter\bin\cache\dart-sdk` which was successfully resolved by terminating locking processes and rebuilding the SDK.
- **Scaffolded Flutter Project**: Initialized `traders_retailer` app, set up the clean architecture folders, configured all core dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`, established routing (`app_router.dart`), and built the theme styles (`app_colors.dart` & `app_theme.dart`).
- **Infrastructure Built**: Implemented production-ready `Dio` API Client (with interceptors) and a robust `Hive` Local Storage Service (for tokens, themes, and search history).

### 💬 Latest Discussion Summary:

1. **Client Questions Prepared**: List of basic questions compiled (Brand details, business model/verification, products/categories, payments/delivery, Google Play Console setup).
2. **Current Setup Work**:
   - Environment check: Successfully cleared the locked `dart-sdk` directory and ran `flutter doctor` to download a fresh SDK. Currently, Flutter is functional, Android licenses are accepted, and SDK tools are configured.
   - Backend planning (Firebase vs. Node.js/MongoDB).
   - Project scaffolding: Completed. Project is fully compiled with placeholders.
   - Initial design exploration: Light/Dark theme configuration implemented using customized design system colors.
   - Infrastructure Layer: Completed API Network Client and Local Storage caching service.

## 📅 Session Log: 2026-07-12

### 📋 Current Status & Tasks completed:

- **Resolved Compilation Errors**:
  - Replaced undefined `FontWeight.semibold` with `FontWeight.w600` in `app_theme.dart`.
  - Upgraded `CardTheme` instantiation to `CardThemeData` to align with Flutter Material 3.
  - Made the `DioExceptionType` switch statement exhaustive by adding a fallback `default` case in `api_exceptions.dart`.
  - Replaced the failing smoke test in `test/widget_test.dart` with a compile-friendly version matching `TradersRetailerApp` and initialized Hive for test environment.
- **Git Repo Setup**:
  - Initialized a local Git repository on `main` branch.
  - Committed all scaffolded files, core themes, network client, and local storage configurations cleanly.

### 💬 Latest Discussion Summary:

1. **Compilation Check**: Confirmed that `flutter analyze` runs with zero issues.
2. **Git Status & Next Step**: Ready to add remote origin and push folder structure as soon as the user provides the GitHub repository URL.

## 📅 Session Log: 2026-07-13

### 📋 Current Status & Tasks completed:

- **Firebase integration**: Added Firebase SDK packages to `pubspec.yaml` and set up `firebase_options.dart` configuration.
- **Resilient Backend Hybrid Engine**: Implemented `FirebaseAuthRepository` supporting both Firebase and a fully simulated Hive database mode. It detects missing/placeholder credentials and falls back to simulation mode to avoid app crashes.
- **Manual Verification & Role-Based Routing**:
  - Implemented `AuthScreen` for sign-up/login with business verification fields.
  - Implemented `PendingApprovalScreen` locking unverified users and displaying client contact details (+91 98604 60325, vishvatejkatkar007@gmail.com).
  - Implemented `AdminDashboardScreen` (owner view) with stats and a functional "Retailer Approval Queue".
  - Implemented `HomeScreen` (customer marketplace) showcasing wholesale categories, items, and minimum order rules (₹2,500).
- **Reactive Navigation**: Wired `appRouterProvider` (GoRouter + Riverpod) to automatically handle state-driven redirects.
- **Fixed Test Suite**: Corrected Firebase dependency initializers and prevented repeating animations from causing timer leaks during widget tests. All tests pass with exit code `0`.
- **GitHub Deployment**: Linked local workspace to GitHub remote (`10Niranjan/Jyoti-Kirana`), resolved `README.md` merge conflicts, and successfully pushed the full Flutter project architecture. Executed dummy commits to fulfill daily contribution streak requirements.

### 💬 Latest Discussion Summary:

1. **Compilation Check**: `flutter analyze` runs with zero issues.
2. **Test Check**: `flutter test` completes successfully with all test assertions passing.

## 📅 Session Log: 2026-07-15

### 📋 Current Status & Tasks completed:

- **Created Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)**: Outlined app purpose, target users (~30 retailers), business rules (min ₹2,500 checkout, manual admin approval), features for admin & retailers, payment flow (COD + UPI QR), and phased rollout plan.
- **Created Architecture Guide (ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Documented 3-layer Clean Architecture (Presentation, Domain, Data), defined full tech stack, mapped exact directory structure, detailed communication flows, database schema (Firestore schemas for users, categories, products, orders), security rules strategy, and performance/testing plans.
- **Created Development Rules (rules.md)**: Codified strict coding and engineering practices, whitelisted approved libraries, banned anti-patterns (e.g., GetX, setState in Riverpod, direct data calls in UI), established file size & method length constraints, error handling patterns, naming conventions, and AI boundaries.
- **Fixed App Name & Title**: Renamed `TradersRetailerApp` to `JyotiKiranaApp` in `lib/main.dart` and `test/widget_test.dart`, and corrected the `MaterialApp` title parameter to `'Jyoti Kirana'` to match the actual client specs.

### 💬 Latest Discussion Summary:

1. **Enterprise-grade Setup**: Aligned and documented the entire product vision, system design, and coding standards in PRD, ARCHITECTURE, and RULES markdown assets.
2. **App Title Corrected**: Cleaned up legacy "Traders Retailer" placeholder naming in code and tests.
3. **GitHub Synced**: Committing and pushing core documentation files to track progress and maintain the daily streak.

## 🛠️ Code Quality & Engineering Rules (15+ Years Experience)

_Every code snippet generated during this project must adhere to these guidelines:_

1. **Clean Architecture & SOLID**: Clean separation between UI (Presentation), Controllers/Notifiers (State), and Data (API/Cache/Models).
2. **Modern State Management**: Use Riverpod with auto-dispose, keeping logic decoupled from the widgets.
3. **High-Performance UI**:
   - Maximize `const` widget caching.
   - Use `ListView.builder` with `itemExtent` for long lists.
   - Use `CachedNetworkImage` with clean shimmers.
4. **Resilient Networking**: Dio HTTP client with interceptors for error handling, JWT refresh, and retry logic.
5. **Type Safety**: Safe serialization/deserialization with null-safe mappings and default fallbacks.
6. **Strict Business Rule Validation**:
   - Always validate minimum checkout amount is ₹2,500.
   - Require account verification/manual approval check on onboarding/login.
   - Show contact support with phone `9860460325` / email `vishvatejkatkar007@gmail.com` if account is pending approval.
   - Support two user roles: Admin (owner) and Normal User. On login, dynamically route Admin to the Admin dashboard (to manage products, categories, and view orders) and Normal Users to the consumer marketplace.
