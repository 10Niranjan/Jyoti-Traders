## 📅 Session Log: 2026-07-09

### 📋 Current Status & Tasks completed:
- Established the **Full Development & Deployment Plan** for the Flutter Retailer App.
- Defined the core feature set, folder structure, and dependencies.
- Created this `agents.md` file to track all sessions, chats, and progress inside the CLI workspace.
- **Identified Flutter SDK issue**: Encountered a write permission error on `C:\Users\niran\flutter\bin\cache\dart-sdk` which was successfully resolved by terminating locking processes and rebuilding the SDK.
- **Scaffolded Flutter Project**: Initialized `traders_retailer` app, set up the clean architecture folders, configured all core dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`, established routing (`app_router.dart`), and built the theme styles (`app_colors.dart` & `app_theme.dart`).
- **Infrastructure Built**: Implemented production-ready `Dio` API Client (with interceptors) and a robust `Hive` Local Storage Service (for tokens, themes, and search history).

### 💬 Latest Discussion Summary:
1. **Client Questions Prepared**: List of basic questions compiled (Brand details, business model/verification, products/categories, payments/delivery, Google Play Console setup).
2. **Current Setup Work**:
   - Environment check: Successfully cleared the locked `dart-sdk` directory and ran `flutter doctor` to download a fresh SDK. Currently, Flutter is functional, Android licenses are accepted, and SDK tools are configured.
   - Backend planning (Firebase vs. Node.js/MongoDB).
   - Project scaffolding: Completed. Project is fully compiled with placeholders.
   - Initial design exploration: Light/Dark theme configuration implemented using customized design system colors.
   - Infrastructure Layer: Completed API Network Client and Local Storage caching service.

## 🛠️ Code Quality & Engineering Rules (15+ Years Experience)
*Every code snippet generated during this project must adhere to these guidelines:*
1. **Clean Architecture & SOLID**: Clean separation between UI (Presentation), Controllers/Notifiers (State), and Data (API/Cache/Models).
2. **Modern State Management**: Use Riverpod with auto-dispose, keeping logic decoupled from the widgets.
3. **High-Performance UI**:
   - Maximize `const` widget caching.
   - Use `ListView.builder` with `itemExtent` for long lists.
   - Use `CachedNetworkImage` with clean shimmers.
4. **Resilient Networking**: Dio HTTP client with interceptors for error handling, JWT refresh, and retry logic.
5. **Type Safety**: Safe serialization/deserialization with null-safe mappings and default fallbacks.
